# Hi everybody, I'm Alf

I'm currently a student at [42 Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/), working hard to complete the 42 Core Curriculum and moving on into the internship phase.
<br><br><br><br><br>

# My current project:

## [Full-Stack Website](https://github.com/alfjl/42HN_ft_transcendence_backbone)
Together with my fellow 42HN peers [aenglert](https://github.com/aenglert42), [NL27](https://github.com/NL27) and [nijakow](https://github.com/nijakow), I'm working on the last project of the 42 Core Curriculum. Goal of this project is to build a **fully functional website** with frontend, backend and database. Users need to run through an authentication process, login and can then play a Pong like game, while chatting with other users, checking out the overall high-score and their opponents profiles.

  
# Some of my 42HN school projets:

## [3D Game](https://github.com/aenglert42/Strassenbau-Simulator-3000)
With my fellow 42HN peer [aenglert](https://github.com/aenglert42), I designed and coded a small game, based on the 90s hit **Wolfenstein 3D**. Goal of this project was to learn more about ray-casting.</br>
