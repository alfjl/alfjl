# Hi everybody,<br>I'm Alf

I'm currently a student at [42 Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/), working hard to complete the 42 Core Curriculum and moving on into the internship phase.
<br><br>
So far I've learned and worked with a couple of different languages and technologies.  
These are the ones I feel most comfortable with:

I have also had some interactions with the following technologies:  
(some a bit more, and some only briefly)

# My current project:

## Full-Stack Website
Together with my fellow 42HN peers [aenglert](https://github.com/aenglert42), [NL27](https://github.com/NL27) and [nijakow](https://github.com/nijakow), I'm working on the last project of the 42 Core Curriculum. Goal of this project is to build a **fully functional website** with frontend, backend and database. Users need to run through an authentication process, login and can then play a Pong like game, while chatting with other users, checking out the overall high-score and their opponents profiles.

# Some of my 42HN school projects:

## [Webserver](https://github.com/alfjl/42HN_webserv)
As the first 'bigger' C++ project, [nijakow](https://github.com/nijakow), [NL27](https://github.com/NL27) and I developed a webserver that was able to serve a fully static website. The goal was to learn more about the HTTP protocol, multithreading vs multiplexing and the use of sockets. 
<br>

## [C++ STL](https://github.com/alfjl/42HN_ft_containers)
As a deep dive into the C++ STL, I re-coded the **std::stack, std::vector, std::map, std::set** (the last two with a self-written **red-black tree** as the underlying data structure), and some of the helper functions and objects like std::pair, iterators, enable_if, and others.
<br>

## [3D Game](https://github.com/alfjl/42HN_Strassenbau-Simulator-3000)
With my fellow 42HN peer [aenglert](https://github.com/aenglert42), I designed and coded a small game, based on the 90s hit **Wolfenstein 3D**. Goal of this project was to learn more about ray-casting.</br>
