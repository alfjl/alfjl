# Hello everybody,<br>I'm Alf

I'm currently a student at [42 Heilbronn](https://www.42heilbronn.de/en/), starting to work on my Mastery in the track of Operating Systems.
Before, I worked hard to finish the 42 Core Curriculum and interned at [Vector Informatik](https://www.vector.com/int/en/), where the main goal of my team was to push forward the development of a future-proof unit testing model for the Embedded C code implementation of the Ethernet driver of the Infineon Aurix Tricore Gen 2.
<br><br>
So far I've learned and worked with a couple of different languages and technologies.  
These are the ones I feel most comfortable with:

I have also had some interactions with the following technologies:

## My current project:

### Full-Stack Website

Together with my fellow 42HN peers [aenglert](https://github.com/aenglert42), [NL27](https://github.com/NL27) and [nijakow](https://github.com/nijakow), I'm working on the last project of the 42 Core Curriculum. Goal of this project is to build a **fully functional website** with frontend, backend and database. Users need to run through an authentication process, login and can then play a Pong like game, while chatting with other users, checking out the overall high-score and their opponents profiles.<br>[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=nestjs,postgres,ts)](https://skillicons.dev)

## Some of my 42HN school projects:

### [Webserver](https://github.com/alfjl/42HN_webserv)

As the first 'bigger' C++ project, [nijakow](https://github.com/nijakow), [NL27](https://github.com/NL27) and I developed a webserver that was able to serve a fully static website. The goal was to learn more about the HTTP protocol, multithreading vs multiplexing and the use of sockets.<br>[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp)](https://skillicons.dev)
<br>

### [C++ STL](https://github.com/alfjl/42HN_ft_containers)

As a deep dive into the C++ STL, I re-coded the **std::stack, std::vector, std::map, std::set** (the last two with a self-written **red-black tree** as the underlying data structure), and some of the helper functions and objects like std::pair, iterators, enable_if, and others.<br>[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=cpp)](https://skillicons.dev)
<br>

### [3D Game](https://github.com/alfjl/42HN_Strassenbau-Simulator-3000)

With my fellow 42HN peer [aenglert](https://github.com/aenglert42), I designed and coded a small game, based on the 90s hit **Wolfenstein 3D**. Goal of this project was to learn more about ray-casting.<br>[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,)](https://skillicons.dev)
